# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
To analyze how other campaigns are doing so Louise can get the most out of hers. 
### Purpose
Louise's play fever is coming close to its fundraising goal in a short amount of time. 
She came to me to search about how other campaigns have performed. How did her 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
I started with breaking down this huge data that was collected. 
I made two seperate sheets to clearly see the outcomes. 
The first data sheet I created was a table to see in which months how many were canceled, successful and failed.
Based on the trend of the line, we can see the most success is from April to August. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
I created a line graph to visualize the results. Image 
From the line graph we can see that when the range is 1000 to 30,000 the goal is increasing but the success
percentage is dropping. 
From 30,000 to 40,000 the goal is increasing and the success percentage is also increasing. It also seems like the 
range from 39,999 to 44,999 it is very steady. 
When the range increased from 44,999 to 49,999 the success rate is dropping. 

## Results
In adidtion to this I want to include if we had more information it would be accurate. Only to show the months 
and how they did, we can not conculed an exact that it is only this. We need more infomation for example as for the 
campaigns being analyzed, we don't have information on where were they organized and what were they fundraising for.
